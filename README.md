propane-simple
==============

Propane-Simple is a work in progress style update for the 37Signals [Campfire™](http://campfirenow.com/) chat mac client [PropaneApp](http://propaneapp.com).

To update your theme replace <code>/styles</code> and <code>/unsupported</code> directories in <code>~/Library/Application\ Support/Propane/</code> directory with those in this repo. Be sure to backup your original copies or they will be gone.

Note: I use [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) to compile the sass/compass however many other apps will work just as fine.

Special thanks to [jonrohan](https://github.com/jonrohan) for his work on the [caveatPatchor.js](https://github.com/jonrohan/organic-propane/blob/master/unsupported/caveatPatchor.js) file.

##Propane Plus
The <code>propaneplus</code> branch is developed for the GitHub's custom version of PropaneApp. One of the many beautiful features you can play with, as a GitHubber.
